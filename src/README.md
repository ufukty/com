# Ufuktan Yıldırım

MSc in Computer Engineering with 10+ years of experience spanning full-stack
development, developer tooling, and independent product ventures. Started with peering
a Bachelor’s capstone project that evolved into a independent venture; an ambitious
social utility app combining mobile and backend development with face-recognition
features. Paused this to focus on another venture, a leaner project on personal product
management tool area, reusing technical foundations while producing impactful open-
source developer tools (e.g., Gohandlers, Gonfique, Dim). Published a master’s thesis on
genetic programming and explored network science through simulations and data
visualizations (e.g., Reddit Galaxy, featured with 5k+ upvotes). Passionate about bridging
deep technical execution with product strategy; from backend architectures and web
application security to branding, documentation, and market validation. Motivated to
contribute to B2C software with high user engagement and to help shape early-stage
product growth.
